A chatbot is a computer program designed to interact with humans through a chat interface, typically in a conversational manner. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to understand and respond to user inputs, aiming to simulate human-like conversations. Chatbots can be found in various applications and platforms, such as messaging apps, websites, customer support systems, and virtual assistants.

The main purpose of a chatbot is to provide information, answer questions, perform tasks, or offer assistance based on predefined rules or machine learning models. Some chatbots are rule-based, where they follow a set of programmed instructions, while others are powered by machine learning algorithms that enable them to learn and improve their responses over time.

Chatbots are utilized in a wide range of domains, including customer service, e-commerce, healthcare, education, and more. They can handle repetitive inquiries, provide instant responses, and offer personalized experiences. By automating certain interactions, chatbots help save time, enhance efficiency, and improve user experiences.

Overall, chatbots are designed to facilitate communication between humans and computers, making it easier and more convenient to interact with various services, obtain information, and perform tasks, all through a conversational interface.
